# @bufbuild/connect-web

This is the runtime library package for Connect-Web. You'll find its code 
generator at [@bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-web).

Connect-Web is a simple library to call remote procedures from a web browser. 
Unlike REST, you get a type-safe client and never have to think about
serialization again.

The procedures are defined in a [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
schema implemented by your backend, and Connect-Web generates the clients and
related types to access the backend. The clients support two protocols:
gRPC-web, and Connect's own protocol.

The [Connect protocol](https://connect.build/docs/protocol/) is a simple,
POST-only protocol that works over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. It supports
server-streaming methods just like gRPC-Web, but is easy to debug in the
network inspector. Calling a Connect API is easy enough just with the fetch
API. Try it with our live demo:

```ts
const res = await fetch("https://demo.connect.build/buf.connect.demo.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Say", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {"content-type": "application/json"},
  body: `{"sentence": "I feel happy."}`
});
const answer = res.json();
console.log(answer);
// {sentence: 'When you feel happy, what do you do?'}
```

Using the client generated by Connect-Web, the same call becomes quite a bit
simpler:

```ts
const answer = await eliza.say({sentence: "I feel happy."});
console.log(answer);
// {sentence: 'When you feel happy, what do you do?'}
```
